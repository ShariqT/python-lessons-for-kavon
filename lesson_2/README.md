In this lesson you will learn: 

1) how to make a program that accepts input from the terminal
2) the difference between functions, variables, and parameters

---------------------------------

Instruction:

To make a python program accept user input, you have to use the "raw_input" function. The following is an example of how to use it...

    name = input("What is your name?")

3) The stuff inside of the parentheses is called an parameter. For this function, it has one parameter -- a string (the stuff in between the quotation marks) that will display in the terminal as the prompt. 

Whatever the user entered will be saved to a variable called "name". The equals sign means that we want the computer to take the result of the function and put the result in a variable called "name" that we can use later.

You already know the "print" function from when we worked together on Sunday. That function takes one parameter -- a string -- that will then be printed on the terminal. 


Homework: 

For your homework, I want you to create a login form. You will ask for the person's Full Name and the username they want to use. After the user puts in the information, you will print what they just entered back out to them. 

Tip: You can format the prompts better if you add a space to end of the text you give the "input" function. A example of this is below...

       name = input("What is your name? ")

It prints out some space so that its easier to see the input that you are entering. 

The part where you print out what the user entered should look like this...

    Your Full Name is:
    <whatever the user entered after the full name prompt>
    Your Username is:
    <whatever the user entered after the username prompt>


(Note: When I do stuff like <whatever the user entered> this is a just placeholder for what the real program would print out.Its not code and I don't want you to print brackets around stuff.)
