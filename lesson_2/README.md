In this lesson you will learn: 

1) how to make a program that accepts input from the terminal
2) the difference between functions, variables, and parameters

---------------------------------

Instruction:

To make a python program accept user input, you have to use the "raw_input" function. The following is an example of how to use it...

    name = raw_input("What is your name?")

3) The stuff inside of the parentheses is called an parameter. For this function, it has one parameter -- a string (the stuff in between the quotation marks) that will display in the terminal as the prompt. 

Whatever the user entered will be saved to a variable called "name". The equals sign means that we want the computer to take the result of the function and put the result in a variable called "name" that we can use later.

You already know the "print" function from when we worked together on Sunday. That function takes one parameter -- a string -- that will then be printed on the terminal. 


Homework: 

Your homework assignment is to make a program that will ask for my name and then print it back out.
