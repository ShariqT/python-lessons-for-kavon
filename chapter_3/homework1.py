# Kavon, I'm trying to make a program that will let me enter a number
# and then will count from 0 to the number I entered, printing out 
# each number. So, if I entered in 3, the program would print out
# '0 1 2 '. I started it but didn't get to finish it. Can 
# you add a while loop to this program to finish it. 
# Note: You are only allowed to add to this program. You cannot 
# change the user_number or the counter variables.


user_number = input("High do you want to count? ")

counter = 0
