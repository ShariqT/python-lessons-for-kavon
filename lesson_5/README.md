We are going to do a little recap of the previous lessons to make sure that you understand the material so far. 
These next two homework assignments will test your abilities:


1) I want a program that will allow me to input three different words. I want you to print out the first letter of each
word. So, for instance, if the three words I enter are "goals", "Yellow", "tiny", then I want the program to print out "gYt". But if the first letters of the three words combine to make "cat", then I want the program to print "meow". (Save this file as homework5a.py)


2) I want a program to make a number guessing game. I want to be able to input a number and if that number is higher than the
answer, then the program should print something like, "that guess was too high" or "go lower". If that number is lower than the answer, then the program should print something like, "that guess was too low" or "go higher". And if I guess correctly, then
the program should print, "winner winner chicken dinner". (Save this file as homework5b.py)
