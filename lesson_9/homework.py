# This is good size project and may take a you a couple of days to finish,
# but ties in a bunch that we have learned so far.
# I want you to make a program will help me learn my times tables
# the program should:
# 1) Ask me which times tables am I trying to learn. 
# 2) Then it will ask me three random math questions about
# that times table. So for example, if I enter in that I am trying to
# learn the 2's time tables, the program will ask me three math questions
# about the 2's time tables like 2 x 3 or 2 x 8 or 2 x 2. The math questions
# must be random.  I don't want you ask me the same math questions over and 
# over. 
# 3) after answering the questions, it will give me a score, like 
# "got 2 out 3 answers correct" and then print out the percentage correct.
