# Kavon, we need to write a password tester so that all of our
# passwords are strong. To make a strong password, it has to be more than 8
# characters long but shorter than 15 characters.
# To be strong the password also has to have a capital letter in first,
# fourth and sixth position. The last two characters of the password have to be
# numbers as well. 

#Write a program that will use a for loop to check all of the passwords in the
# 'password_list' variable and print out whether or not the password was strong.

# Note: you can add whatever you want to this program, but you can't change the
# variable called passwords.
