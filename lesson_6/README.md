Ok, so here are a few exercises that go over what we have learned 
so far. You'll have to look back through some of the notes if you want
to get of them correct. 

Also, as a hint, remember what we talked about on Sunday:

If you want to change a value into a integer, you would do 
        
        int(myvariable)

If you wanted to change a value into a float, you would do

        float(myvariable)


And if you wanted to change a value into a string, you would do


        str(myvariable)
